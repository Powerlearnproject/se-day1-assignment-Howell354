# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles ,methods and tools in developing and maintaining quality software systems



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968- first software engineering conference held
1970s -new methodologies are developed 
1980s- CASE tools are released

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.requirement-the collection and documentation of systen requirements and user needs
2.design- creating detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
3.implementation- writing codes to build the software as per the design
4.testing-the software undergoes several tests to ensure proper functioning
5.deployment-   releasing software to customers 
6.maintenance- regular updates of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is a sequential approach where different phases follow eachother chronologically where agile is an incremental approach that focuses on collaboration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.software developer writes codes and implements software solutions
2.Quality assuarance engineer designs and executes tests to verify the quality of software
3.project manager mans the planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help in developing software code efficiently example visual studio
VCS enable several developers to work on same project simultaneously example git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some challenges include time constrains and changing requirements.To solve the issues it is advisable to work earlier and have regular updates on software respectively

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit integration are tests to ensure whole segment performs accordingly
system testing is used gauge the complete system to ensure it meets specified requirements
acceptance- is used to determine if the software is ready for deployment
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the creation of precise questions to get the best responses from AI it ensures the user gets the required information at its best

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about pineapple farming.
Explain about pineapple farming method used in kericho,kenya.
It gives a clear and more accurate information that tailors the users needs to their best understanding
